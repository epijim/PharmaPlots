# RochePlot R Package

This package contains simple wrappers for plots we repeatedly do.

## Help using functions

Please see the *Functions* link above for an HTML version of the help functions. You can also use `?` in R to get help, as the functions have help files built in.

## For developers

Steps to update the package

1. Make a branch off master
1. Make your changes
1. Test your changes
1. Run `devtools::document()` to rebuild the docs.
1. Run `pkgdown::pkgdown::build_site()`
    * If you added a function, you'll get an error now. Add the function to _pkgdown.yaml as it says
1. Make a merge request to the master branch.

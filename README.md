## Introduction <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

This package contains simple wrappers for plots we repeatedly do.

## Help using functions

Documentation for this package is at
<https://pages.github.roche.com/Rpackages/RochePlot> Please report
issues on github.roche.com.

Please see the *Functions* link above for an HTML version of the help
functions. You can also use `?` in R to get help, as the functions have
help files built in.

See vignettes for example code on how to make plots using Flatiron data.
